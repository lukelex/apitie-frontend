instructions below to manually sign your requests.</p>

<h2>
  How does it work?
</h2>

<p>Before making the API call, combine the HTTP method
(GET, POST, etc), the utc timestamp of the request, with the
string representation of your parameters. Hash (HMAC-SHA1) the
blob of data (from Step #1) with your private key assigned to you
by the system. Send the server the following data in the header
of your request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>* Your app Public Key assigned to you by the system. This
  is a public value that anyone (even evil masterminds can know
  and you donâ€™t mind). It is just a way for the system to know
  WHO is sending the request, not if it should trust the sender
  or not (we figure that out based on the HMAC);</li>
  <li>* Send the utc timestamp, in seconds, of the request;</li>
  <li>* Send the HASH (HMAC) you generated;</li>
  <li>* Send all the data (parameters and values) you were
  planning on sending anyway, like
  <code>mode=start&number=4&order=desc</code>.</li>
</ul>

app would provide:</p>
